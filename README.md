In this competition, our aim is to develop an AI model that can score student essays. This competition is actually an updated version of an old one that took place over a decade ago. In this version, we aim to improve upon essay scoring algorithms to enhance student learning outcomes. This notebook will guide you through the process of fine-tuning the **DebertaV3** model using **Ordinal Regression/Classification** to score student essays using KerasNLP.

**Did you know**: This notebook is backend-agnostic, which means it supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends. However, the best performance can be achieved with `JAX`. KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of the preferred backend. Explore further details on [Keras](https://keras.io/keras_3/).

**Note**: For a deeper understanding of KerasNLP, refer to the [KerasNLP guides](https://keras.io/keras_nlp/).

> Training and Inference notebook is available in [/notebooks](./notebooks) and you can also access it on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/awsaf49/aes-2-0-kerasnlp-starter).
