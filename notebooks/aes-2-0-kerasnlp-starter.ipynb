This competition is actually an updated version of an old one that took place over a decade ago. In this version, we aim to improve upon essay scoring algorithms to enhance student learning outcomes. This notebook will guide you through the process of fine-tuning the **DebertaV3** model using **Ordinal Regression/Classification** to score student essays using KerasNLP.\n\n**Did you know**: This notebook is backend-agnostic, which means it supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends. However, the best performance can be achieved with `JAX`. KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of the preferred backend. Explore further details on [Keras](https://keras.io/keras_3/).\n\n**Note**: For a deeper understanding of KerasNLP, refer to the [KerasNLP guides](https://keras.io/keras_nlp/).","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.012811,"end_time":"2024-04-04T17:26:16.784578","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-04T17:26:16.771767","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 📚 | Import Libraries ","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.012617,"end_time":"2024-04-04T17:26:16.810071","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-04T17:26:16.797454","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nos.environ[\"KERAS_BACKEND\"] = \"jax\"  #

Unlike in typical classification problems where the target variable is categorical, in ordinal regression the target variable has a ordering or ranking. It is also different from typical regression, where the target variable is continuous. In ordinal regression, the target variable has a discrete, ordered set of values, such as levels of satisfaction or performance grades.\n\n**Why do we need it?**\nOrdinal regression is useful when the target variable (in our competition, the `score` of an essay) represents a ranking or order. Specifically, ordinal regression can capture the inherent order in the target variable, which standard classification models may not be able to do effectively.\n\nFor Ordinal Regression, we have to transform the labels, which is different from typical classification or regression.

This process starts with tokenization, where input strings are converted into sequences of token IDs.\n\n**Why it's important:** Initially, raw text data is complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. By converting text into a compact set of tokens, such as transforming `\"The quick brown fox\"` into `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]`, we simplify the data. Many models rely on special tokens and additional tensors to understand input. These tokens help divide input and identify padding, among other tasks. Making all sequences the same length through padding boosts computational efficiency, making subsequent steps smoother.\n\nExplore the following pages to access the available preprocessing and tokenizer layers in **KerasNLP**:\n- [Preprocessing](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/preprocessing_layers/)\n- [Tokenizers](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/tokenizers/)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.01354,"end_time":"2024-04-04T17:26:33.970237","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-04T17:26:33.956697","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"preprocessor = keras_nlp.models.DebertaV3Preprocessor.from_preset(\n    preset=CFG.preset, # Name of the model\n    sequence_length=CFG.sequence_length, # Max sequence length, will be padded if shorter\n)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":2.92789,"end_time":"2024-04-04T17:26:36.91194","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-04T17:26:33.98405","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-21T03:44:20.911499Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-21T03:44:20.911765Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-21T03:44:23.28017Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-21T03:44:20.911741Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-21T03:44:23.279158Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, let's examine what the output shape of the preprocessing layer looks like.
